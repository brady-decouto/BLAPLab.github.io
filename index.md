  <h2>What is the BLAP Lab?</h2>

  <p>
  The Brain, Learning, Attention, and Performance (BLAP) Lab contains research focused on measuring psychophysiological processes (e.g., attention) related to human learning, expert performance, and cognitive health. In our work, we use biometric sensors such as electroencephalography (EEG), eye-tracking, and skin conductance to measure cognitive or emotional processes during perceptual-motor tasks. We are particularly interested in how emerging assistive technological tools impact cognition and motor learning processes.
